		"options": ["Stack", "Queue", "Array", "Tree"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "A Queue follows FIFO principle, like a line at a store - the first person in line is served first. Stacks use LIFO (Last In First Out)."

		"options": ["Queue", "Stack", "Array", "Linked List"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "A Stack follows LIFO principle, like a stack of plates - you take from the top (last added) first. Queues use FIFO (First In First Out)."

		"questionText": "What is the standard file extension for Python source code files?",
		"options": [".python", ".py", ".pt", ".pyt"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "Python source code files use the .py extension. This tells the operating system and editors that the file contains Python code."

		"options": ["end", "sep", "separator", "split"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "The 'sep' parameter controls what appears between values. For example: print('A', 'B', sep='-') outputs 'A-B'."

		"questionText": "What is the default separator in Python's print() function when printing multiple values?",
		"options": ["comma", "newline", "space", "tab"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,

		"questionText": "Which escape character represents a newline (line break) in Python strings?",
		"options": ["\\t", "\\n", "\\r", "\\b"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "\\n creates a new line. \\t is tab, \\r is carriage return, and \\b is backspace."

		"questionText": "What is the default value of the 'end' parameter in Python's print() function?",
		"options": ["space", "empty string", "newline", "tab"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,
		"explanation": "By default, print() ends with a newline (\\n), which is why each print() statement appears on a new line unless you change the 'end' parameter."
	},
	{
		"questionText": "Which symbol is used for single-line comments in Python?",
		"options": ["//", "#", "/*", "--"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "Python uses # for single-line comments. Everything after # on that line is ignored by Python. // is used in Java/C++, /* */ in C-style languages."

		"questionText": "What escape sequence is used to represent a tab character in Python strings?",
		"options": ["\\n", "\\t", "\\s", "\\tab"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "\\t inserts a tab character (typically 4-8 spaces). \\n is newline, \\s and \\tab are not valid Python escape sequences."

			"python -check",
			"python --version",
			"python -v",
			"check python"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "The command 'python --version' or 'python -V' displays your installed Python version. This helps verify Python is installed correctly."

		"options": [
			"Only double quotes",
			"Only single quotes",
			"Both single and double quotes",
			"Only backticks"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,
		"explanation": "Python accepts both single quotes ('text') and double quotes (\"text\") for strings. Choose based on what's inside the string - use single quotes if your string contains double quotes and vice versa."

	{
		"questionText": "In Python, how do you write a single backslash character inside a string literal?",
		"options": [
			"Use single backslash: '\\'",
			"Use double backslash: '\\\\'",
			"Use forward slash: '/'",
			"Use double forward slash: '//'"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "You write '\\\\' in your code (two backslashes) to represent one backslash in the actual string. The first backslash escapes the second one."

			"print('Name' 'Age')",
			"print('Name' + 'Age')",
			"print('Name', 'Age')",
			"print('Name'; 'Age')"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,
		"explanation": "Use commas to separate multiple values: print('Name', 'Age') outputs 'Name Age'. Option 1 concatenates without space, option 2 concatenates strings, option 4 has invalid syntax."

			"Hello on one line, World on next line",
			"Hello World on the same line",
			"HelloWorld with no space",
			"Error"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,
		"explanation": "The first print() uses end='' (empty string) instead of the default newline, so 'World' appears immediately after 'Hello' with no space or newline between them."

			"Command line using 'python filename.py'",

			"Interactive Python Shell (REPL)",
			"Compiling to .exe first using javac"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "Python doesn't require compilation like Java. While tools like PyInstaller CAN create .exe files, it's not the standard method. Python code runs directly through the Python interpreter."

		"options": ["A B C", "A-B-C", "ABC", "A, B, C"],

			"For variable names",
			"For importing modules"

		"questionText": "Which of the following is a good commenting practice in Python?",
		"options": [
			"Comment every single line of code",
			"Explain WHY the code does something, not WHAT it does",
			"Use comments instead of meaningful variable names",
			"Never use comments because good code is self-documenting"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "Good comments explain the reasoning and purpose (WHY), not the obvious mechanics (WHAT). Use meaningful names for the WHAT, and comments for the WHY. Avoid over-commenting obvious code."

		"options": [
			"Single quote character",
			"Double quote character",
