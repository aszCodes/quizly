		"options": [".jdk", ".class", ".jar", ".java"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "Java source code files use the .java extension. After compilation, they become .class files (bytecode). .jar files are Java archives."

		"questionText": "What command compiles Java source code into bytecode?",
		"options": ["run", "javac", "compile", "java"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "The 'javac' (Java Compiler) command compiles .java files into .class bytecode. Example: javac Program.java creates Program.class"

	{
		"questionText": "What command executes a compiled Java program?",
		"options": ["execute", "javac", "run", "java"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "The 'java' command runs Java bytecode. Example: java Program (no .class extension needed). The JVM executes the bytecode."

		"questionText": "What rule must public Java classes follow regarding filenames?",
		"options": [
			"Only the first letter must match",
			"File name must match the public class name exactly (case-sensitive)",
			"They can be completely different",
			"File name should be lowercase version of class name"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "A public class MUST be in a file with the identical name (case-sensitive). 'public class Main' requires 'Main.java'. Non-public classes have flexibility."

		"questionText": "What punctuation ends every Java statement?",
		"options": ["Comma (,)", "Period (.)", "Colon (:)", "Semicolon (;)"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "Every Java statement ends with a semicolon (;). It marks where statements end and new ones begin. Missing semicolons cause errors."

			"print()",
			"System.print()",
			"System.out.print()",

		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "System.out.println() prints and adds a newline at the end. 'println' means 'print line'."

			"println() only works with strings",
			"No difference, they work the same",
			"println() adds a new line (line break) after printing",
			"print() is faster than println()"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,
		"explanation": "print() outputs without a newline, keeping the cursor on the same line. println() adds a newline, moving to the next line."

		"questionText": "What escape sequence creates a new line in Java?",
		"options": ["\\b", "\\r", "\\n", "\\t"],

	{
		"questionText": "Which escape sequence inserts a tab character in Java?",
		"options": ["\\tab", "\\t", "\\n", "\\s"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "\\t creates a tab character (usually 4-8 spaces). Example: System.out.println(\"Age:\\t25\"); adds spacing between Age: and 25."

			"' This is a comment",
			"# This is a comment",
			"// This is a comment",
			"<!-- This is a comment -->"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,

		"options": [
			"''' comment '''",
			"<!-- comment -->",
			"// comment //",

			"System.out.println()",
			"system.out.println()",
			"System.Out.Println()",
			"SYSTEM.OUT.PRINTLN()"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 0,
		"explanation": "Java is case-sensitive. Use System.out.println() with capital 'S', lowercase 'out' and 'println'. Any variation causes compilation errors."

		"options": [
			"Angle brackets < >",
			"Parentheses ( )",
			"Square brackets [ ]",
			"Curly braces { }"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "Curly braces { } mark code blocks. They define the boundaries of classes, methods, loops, and conditionals. Matching braces is crucial."

	{
		"questionText": "What is the required entry point for standalone Java applications?",
		"options": ["execute()", "start()", "run()", "main()"],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "The main() method is where execution begins. The JVM searches for this method to start your program. Without it, programs won't run."

			"public main(String[] args)",
			"static void main(String[] args)",
			"public void main()",
			"public static void main(String[] args)"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "The main method must be: public (accessible), static (no object needed), void (no return), with String[] args (command-line arguments)."

		"options": [
			"CALCULATOR.java",
			"calculator.java",
			"Calculator.java",
			"calc_ulator.java"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 2,
		"explanation": "The filename must exactly match the public class name with correct capitalization: Calculator.java. Java is case-sensitive."

		"questionText": "How do you include one backslash (\\) in a Java string?",

			"Use \\back",
			"Use double backslash (escape it): \"\\\\\"",
			"Use single backslash: \"\\\"",
			"Use forward slash: \"/\""
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "Write \\\\ (two backslashes) to get one backslash in the string. The first escapes the second. Example: String path = \"D:\\\\Files\\\\\";"

		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "Use \\\" to include quotes in strings. Example: System.out.println(\"She said \\\"Hi\\\"\"); outputs: She said \"Hi\""

			".bin binary file",
			".jar archive file",
			".exe executable file",
			".class bytecode file"

		"correctAnswerIndex": 3,
		"explanation": "The compiler (javac) produces .class files with bytecode. This bytecode runs on any system with a JVM, enabling platform independence."
	},
	{
		"questionText": "What happens when a semicolon is missing from a Java statement?",
		"options": [
			"Only a runtime error occurs when you run the program",
			"A compilation error occurs and the program won't compile",
			"The program runs normally",
			"A warning appears but the program still runs"
		],
		"correctAnswerIndex": 1,
		"explanation": "Missing semicolons cause compilation errors. The compiler shows errors like 'error: ';' expected' and won't create bytecode until fixed."
